## Eclipse Passage™ Floating License Server component fork

A fork of [Eclipse Passage™](https://github.com/eclipse-passage/passage) to continue the maintenance of the _Floating License Server_ (FLS) component, which has been removed from the upstream project:
- https://github.com/eclipse-passage/passage/issues/1404

Because we still consider the FLS relevant, we continue to maintain only the missing pieces of it in this fork, on a best effort basis and on our own discretion.
Still, contributions from anybody are welcome and we hope that the FLS will make its way back to the upstream Eclipse-Passage project one day.
